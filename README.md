# Figo Restaurant Landing Page

This project is a restaurant landing page consisting of several sections: home, welcome, why choose us, menu, recipe search and footer. 

The recipe section leverages an external public API called "Low Carb Recipes". A user can filter out recipes by providing a recipe name, tag(dietary preference) and ingredient to exclude.
